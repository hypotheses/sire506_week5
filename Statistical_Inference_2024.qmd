    -   Normal Distribution

    -   Poisson

-   Asymptotics

    -   Law of Large Number

    -   Central Limit Theorem

    -   Confidence Interval

## \[Confidence Interval\]([07 03 Asymptotics and confidence intervals \| Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference/lecture/RxU7M/07-03-asymptotics-and-confidence-intervals))

For 95% confidence interval, this interval has 95% probability to contain $\mu$.

The actual interpretation of this is that if we were to repeatedly get samples of size n from this population. Construct a confidence interval in each case. About 95% of the intervals we obtained would contain $\mu$ the parameter that we're trying to estimate.

## Wald's Confidence Interval

-   Assuming asymptotic with CTL

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(UsingR)
data(father.son)
x <- father.son$height # height in inches
n = length(x)
# divide by 12 to get 95% CI of mean height in feet
(mean(x) + c(-1,1) * qnorm(0.975) * sd(x)/sqrt(n))/12 
```

## Binomial CI

```{r}
# for p = 0.56, n = 100
0.56 + qnorm(0.975) * c(-1,1) * sqrt(0.56*0.44/100)
# [1] 0.4627099 0.6572901
# or using binom.test using exact test
binom.test(56, 100)$conf.int
# [1] 0.4571875 0.6591640
# attr(,"conf.level")
# [1] 0.95
```

## Agresti/Coull Confidence Interval

-   When n isn't large enough for CLT to be applicable of the p-value.
